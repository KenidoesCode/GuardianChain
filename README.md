# 🛡️ GuardianChain

### 🔗 A Blockchain-Powered Security Layer for Financial Trust

## 🚀 Overview

**GuardianChain** is a decentralized financial security protocol designed to safeguard digital transactions, user data, and financial integrity. Built on **Ethereum** using **Solidity**, it aims to create a tamper-proof reputation system and fraud-resistant financial ecosystem.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

In India’s fast-growing fintech landscape:

* 💸 **₹1500+ crore** is lost annually to scams and frauds.
* 🧾 **No unified financial trust layer** exists across apps and banks.
* 🤝 **Peer-to-peer lending lacks transparency and credibility.**
* 🔐 **Data privacy and trust** are often compromised in centralized systems.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution — *GuardianChain*

GuardianChain creates a **blockchain-secured trust and reputation layer** for financial users:

* ✅ **Reputation Smart Contracts**: Immutable trust scores based on transaction behavior.
* 💳 **Decentralized Escrow System**: Prevents scams during fund transfers.
* 🤖 **AI-powered Risk Detection (future integration)**: Flags suspicious or risky activity.
* 🔗 **Transparent Ledger**: Every transaction is traceable, verifiable, and tamper-proof.

GuardianChain acts as a **digital security firewall** for fintech and DeFi platforms — bridging **trust + transparency + technology**.

## 🧠 Core Architecture

1. **Smart Contracts:** Solidity-based contracts for escrow, reputation, and user registry.
2. **Backend:** Foundry for development, deployment, and testing.
3. **Frontend:** React + Vite for user dashboard and interaction.
4. **Blockchain:** Ethereum testnet (Goerli / Sepolia).
